A very simple python script to bulk resize images to desired size.

# Usage
[Install the required dependencies.](DEPENDENCIES.md)
Make sure the script is in a seperate folder *along with the images you want resized.*
Once ran you'll be asked to input your desired width, height and whether to preserve the aspect ratio of the images.
This script supports [most common image formats](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#fully-supported-formats), any other files will be ignored.
