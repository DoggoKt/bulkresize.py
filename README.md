A very simple python script to bulk resize images to desired size.

# Usage
* [Install Python and dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md) or [download a pre-built binary for Windows](/releases/latest). (If you're not sure, pick the pre-built binary)
Always make sure the script is in a seperate folder **along with the images you want resized** prior to running it.
Once ran you'll be asked to input your desired width, height and whether to preserve the aspect ratio of the images, which will then be saved - resized - in a separate file including the new size in the filename.
This script supports [most common image formats](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#fully-supported-formats), any other files will be ignored.
